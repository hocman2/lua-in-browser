A minimal project to run lua in browser client side. It exports the Lua C API to Javascript 
Only tested in browser for now

## How to use
`./build.sh` to generate a lua.js and lua.wasm file (requires emsdk)
Drop these files in any web project then:
1. `import Module from "lua.js"`
2. Either `const lua = await Module()` or `Module().then((lua) => { ... })`

Console log that object to see what functions are available, for now you need to manually copy the content of the lua file in the wasm memory and call `_executeLua(ptr)`
All of Lua standard library should work (even IO, but it's not persistent storage)

## Minimal working example
Need to rewrite

## TODO
[] - Export the debug library
[] - Rewrite some macros to make them usable in js
